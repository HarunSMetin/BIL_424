# Game Project of BIL 424 Lecture

Artificial Intelligence EVA is a tutorial game where you are guided by an artificial intelligence that appears when you turn on your computer. It will guide you to protect your systems and get rid of viruses. The AI will help you detect and neutralize viruses. You will clean the computer from viruses by completing tasks. Are you ready, Artificial Intelligence EVA is waiting for you! Have fun!

## Interactive Computer Interface
Thanks to this interface I wrote, you can switch between levels. User preferences such as username, game difficulty, game volume are integrated into the interface by integrating them into the game story. There is a search engine and mail service.  The file manager allows access to saved game files, and Game Episodes can be accessed through applications on the desktop.

- Due to lack of time, the programs in the interface could be made more specific.
- Due to the lack of an asset that meets the requirements, the development of the entire interface in the context of the game story by ourselves took a lot of time, but contributed to our self-development to a high degree

### First Episode 
BRUTE FORCE ATTACK's algorithm is simple model it in some way aimed at teaching screenshot of our scene

- It was difficult to make the map due to the design of the prefabs in the asset found according to the point of view.
- The process was prolonged due to the late discovery of the shape to be used to replace the boxes.

### Second Episode 
The foundation of Machine Learning Artificial Neural Networks structure, model it in a simple way aimed at teaching screenshot of our scene

- Creating the prefab of the neural network and making logical changes through the code after dynamically defining this prefab was challenging.
- It took time to give information to the user about the objects they are looking at by continuous ray casting to give information.

### Final Episode
Our final episode to teach Firewall and confront the purpose of artificial intelligence
